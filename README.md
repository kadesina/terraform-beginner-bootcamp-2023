## Semantic Versioning

This Project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)


The general format: 

 **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the: `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH 
            format.
